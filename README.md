# Frontend from the ground up

A workshop teaching frontend from first principles

There are three folders here:

1. `lessons`: each sub-folder here is a lesson. You cans:
   1. Install the package via `npm install`
   1. Read the readme of the lesson and run whatever is there according to the readme
   1. Run the tests via `npm test`

1. `exercises`: each subfolder contains the exercises for the corresponding lesson. You can:
   1. Install the package via `npm install`
   1. Read the readme of the folder to understand the exercise
   1. Do the exercise
   1. Check if you're right by running the tests via `npm test`

1. `exercises-solved`: if you're a lazy bum, you can just view the solved exercises here and verify
   that they work by running `npm install && npm test`
